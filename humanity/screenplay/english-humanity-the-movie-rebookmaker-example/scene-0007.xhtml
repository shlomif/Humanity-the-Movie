         The conversation goes on. While in it a young man walks down the street
three times. In the third time, Gideon asks him.

I ask why?

just thought that if I turn left all the time I’ll scan the whole
neighbourhood.

            <p><strong class="sayer">Gideon:</strong> No, this won’t work. You see: if you turn left here <span class="inlinedesc">[shows with his
hand]</span>, go along the street, and then turn left here, <span class="inlinedesc">[the young man turns his
head around]</span>, and then left here <span class="inlinedesc">[again, he twists his head]</span>, and here, you’ll
be in the same place where you started.

wall, like this <span class="inlinedesc">[ puts his hand on the right wall relative to the camera ]</span> and
then by keeping it on the same wall, you’ll go throughout the entire maze. I’ll
do it, thanks! <span class="inlinedesc">[He starts to walk.]</span></p>

going around it again and again. Again.

about it, and he said he had an improved algorithm, that did not have this
limitation…
